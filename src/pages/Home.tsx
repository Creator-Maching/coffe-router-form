          Official Recruitment Notice – The Guild of Coffe ☕🐈‍⬛
        </p>

        <p>
          In a world where unexpected bugs appear without warning, paths are poorly documented,
          and chaos often disguises itself as normality, one guild continues to stand firm.
        </p>

        <p>
          Under the supreme leadership of <strong>Coffe the Cat</strong> — a feline archmage,
          master of silent observation, and guardian of strategic rest — we officially open
          our call for new members.
        </p>

        <h2>Who We Are Looking For</h2>
        <p>
          We seek a <strong>Mage</strong> or <strong>Warlock</strong> willing to face difficult
          missions and join our guild team. The ideal candidate:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Has knowledge of arcane arts or forbidden pacts</li>
          <li>Is not afraid of complex and confusing challenges</li>
          <li>Can adapt to unexpected failures and long nights</li>
          <li>Possesses curiosity, resilience, and a sense of humor</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Previous experience with ancient spellbooks, forgotten systems, or invisible enemies
          is welcome, but not required.
        </p>

        <h2>The Missions</h2>
        <p>
          Guild missions may include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Exploring unknown territories</li>
          <li>Solving problems that “should not exist”</li>
          <li>Interpreting mystical signs (or strategic meows)</li>
          <li>Working as a team under pressure — and coffee ☕</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Not all missions are clear. Not all are fair.
          But every mission leads to growth.
        </p>

        <h2>About the Guild of Coffe</h2>
        <p>
          The guild proudly bears the name of its leader by merit, not just cuteness
          (although there is plenty of that as well).
        </p>

        <p>
          Coffe observes everything from above, sleeps during planning sessions,
          appears exactly when something goes wrong, and judges silently.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our values include loyalty, authenticity, continuous growth,
          and deep respect for rest — especially Coffe’s.
        </p>

        <h2>Rewards</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Constant evolution</li>
          <li>Stories worth telling</li>
          <li>A place in something greater than a single mission</li>
          <li>The honor of serving under Coffe’s watchful gaze</li>
        </ul>
