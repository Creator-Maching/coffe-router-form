        <h1>About the Guild of Coffe</h1>

        <p>
          The Guild of Coffe was founded under the silent supervision of
          <strong> Coffe the Cat</strong>, a mysterious feline known for his
          strategic naps and impeccable timing.
        </p>

        <p>
          What started as a simple gathering of curious minds quickly evolved
          into a guild focused on tackling complex missions, embracing learning,
          and surviving chaos with coffee and patience.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          We believe that growth comes from facing difficult challenges,
          asking the right questions, and not giving up when things suddenly
          turn blank or stop working for no apparent reason.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Curiosity over fear</li>
          <li>Consistency over perfection</li>
          <li>Learning over shortcuts</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Coffe?</h2>
        <p>
          Coffe does not code. Coffe does not debug.
          Yet Coffe always knows when something is wrong.
        </p>

        <p>
          His presence reminds us to slow down, observe carefully,
          and trust the process — even when the solution is just one small fix away.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Guild of Coffe is not just about completing missions,
          but about becoming stronger with each one.
